# Neural Network Weight Evolution Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial that demonstrates how the summary statistics of neural network (NN) weights evolve as the NN gets trained over epochs for a problem of your choice. 

## Introduction

Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that learn to perform tasks by adjusting their internal parameters, known as weights. Understanding how these weights evolve during the training process can provide valuable insights into the learning dynamics of the model.

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial in this repository provides step-by-step guidance on analyzing and visualizing the evolution of NN weights over epochs. It covers the following key aspects:

- Setting up the neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Training the model with different batch sizes.
- Tracking the summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) of weights in each layer over epochs.
- Visualizing the weight evolution using matplotlib plots.

## Usage

To run the tutorial:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-weight-evolution.git
    ```

2. Make sure you have all the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run each cell sequentially
